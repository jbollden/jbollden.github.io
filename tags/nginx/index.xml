      <description>I wanted to secure my Nginx web server with the use of this new free service Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt and the people over at DigitalOcean are always busy making sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of great tutorials for the rest of us.
Following the instructions in &amp;ldquo;How To Secure Nginx with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt on Ubuntu 14.04&amp;rdquo; has nos given me HTTPS-capabilities.
This blog is, at the time of writing, running on Ghost, an awesome node.</description>

      <description>In moving my personal site from a Rackspace Cloud Server to a Raspberry Pi I was looking for a lightweight substitution for the earlier used CMS concrete5. I found GetSimple CMS:
 GetSimple is an XML based, stand-a-alone, fully independant and lite Content Management System. To go along with its best-in-class user interface, we have loaded it with features that every website needs, but with nothing it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. GetSimple is truly the simplest way to manage a small-business website.</description>
