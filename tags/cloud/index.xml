      <description>Since the applications, data, and services on my Rackspace (this) server is becoming more and more important I decided to look into Rackspace&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Backup service. However, I ran into trouble during the setup of the service, and this article tries to describe how it was solved.
I followed their guide to Install the Agent. There is an AUR for the driveclient that could be used, but at the moment I&amp;rsquo;m not that keen on using AUR&amp;rsquo;s, and at the time of writing the version in the AUR is also a bit old.</description>

      <description>With June 3rd came an update for Arch Linux that gave me some server trouble I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recover from. I had to start my Rackspace server in Rescue Mode to get my data back (files and databases). On the upside I found that Rackspace had upgraded the image to build from, now it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Arch 2013.2&amp;rdquo;. So I rebuilt the server from that image. This article describes how I upgraded the server and created a new image that could be used for creating new servers on Rackspace.</description>
