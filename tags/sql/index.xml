      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not completely uncommon to come across databases set to use collations and/or code pages where the ORDER BY clause won&amp;rsquo;t sort as expected; e.g. Åke might be sorted before Carl.
A quick fix to this is to use either the CAST()- or the CONVERT()-function on the text field you wish to sort by. I tend to use CAST() since it&amp;rsquo;s ANSI standard. However, CONVERT() works with all data types, while CAST() don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>If you, as I, think that phpMyAdmin is a useful tool but unnecessarily complex in regards of installation and user experience, then SQL Buddy might be the alternative for you.
SQL Buddy is a web based administration tool for MySQL written in PHP. This tool is simple to use, yet potent enough to meet all the basic and some of the advanced needs one might have when working with MySQL databases.</description>
